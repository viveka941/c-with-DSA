Java Source File Structure

  class A{}
  class B{}
  class C{}


-> Many class in one java File.
-> Atmost one class one declare with should be public.
->which one is declare with public class this file 
   save java programe name.
->
class A{}
class B{}
public class C {} // this is file should be save C file name is C.java

-> there are multiple public classes this declare wiht public then is given complier error 



class A{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("A class main");
  }
}

class B{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("B class main);
  }
}

class C{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("C class main);
  }
}

// there are no have public class then you can give any name above class 


what is default -> within the same current package 
abstract method -> not complete , something particeal
what is abstract method
  abstract method has only declareation not 
 1. public abstract void m1(){}
 2. public void m1();
 3.public abstract void m1();✅
 4.public void m1(){};✅

 abstract class test{
  public abstract void m1();✅
  public void m1();❌❌

 }

 abstract class ->some resosns partial 
 no one create object jast partial

// Virtual function is a  member function in the case class that you redefine in th derived class.

 interfaces ->1. any service require specification (SRS) than it is provided can implelmentation
    2.any contract between clinet and service provider
    100%,pure,abstract,class
  

----------------<OOPs>--------------------
1.Data Hiding:(Encapsulation) ->outside not access data there has getter setter


abstraction->(means not complete)->hide interanl information or implelmentation
what is main purpose data Hiding(abstraction) ->security,enhancement(without effecting outside person),maintainblility(),
disadvatage > getter and setter and increase line of code , perfomence is down
example->online transfer amount (otp,card details,)
example -> ATM machine what happend in behind

Encapsulation:-all require is definen in singal unit.
every java class has Encapsulation
Encapsulation= data Hiding + abstraction;
example:- 
class Account{
  privete double balance;
  public double getBalance(){
    // valid
    return balance;
  }
  public void setBalance(double amount ){
    // validations
    this.balance=balance+amount
  }
}
