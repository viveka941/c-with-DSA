Overloading =  same neme but different paramiter 
 Overloading= function may or may not have different return types but they musth have different arguments.


 constructor is methos special types of memberfunction that is caled automatically when an object is created.  
 it do't have return type .
 there are three types of 
 1. default constructor == when carete new object than auto called default constructor 
 2. copy constructor  
       public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
 
    public Person(Person another) {
        this(another.name, another.age);
 }
 3. paramiter constructor


 multiLeve Inheritance 
        Class A 
          ||
        class B 
          ||
        class C 
MultiPle Inheritance
 many prents  one child 
 child can acces all peroperties.

Polymorphism 
1. complie time 
    ->Function Overloading
    (same name diff paramiter) 
    ->Function Overriding ( in which we redefine the member function of a class which it inherited from its base class) 
    ->Operator Overloading ()
2. run time -> Virtual function



import two types
1. emplicity import -> import java.util.*;
2. exlicit  import  -> import java.util.Arraylist ;

Package  -> gorup is data in signal entity 
class inside  java.long is not require import Package



java
    util
        regex
            pattern

which one is you can perfer
1. import java.*;
2. import java.util.*;
3. import java.util.regex.*; âœ…
